// Task: Develop a Decentralized Voting System
// Description:
// Your task is to design and implement a simple decentralized voting system for a small community using Solidity. The system should allow eligible voters to vote for candidates in an election and should be resistant to double voting. The voting contract should be deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.
// Requirements:
// 1. Voter Registration: Implement a function that allows the owner of the contract to register voters. Only registered voters should be able to vote.
// 2. Candidate Registration: Implement a function that allows candidates to be added. Assume that only the owner of the contract can add candidates.
// 3. Voting: Implement a function that allows registered voters to vote for a candidate. Each voter should only be able to vote once. Attempting to vote again should result in an error.
// 4. Winner Declaration: Implement a function to determine the winner of the election based on the candidate with the most votes. Suppose there may be hundreds or thousands of candidates.
// 5. Security: Ensure that the contract is not vulnerable to common attacks (like re-entrancy, integer overflow and underflow etc.)
// 6. Testing: Write tests for your smart contract to ensure it behaves as expected.

// The minimum duration of an election is 1 day
uint64 constant MINIMUM_ELECTION_DURATION = 60*60*24;
// The maximum duration of an election is 1 year
uint64 constant MAXIMUM_ELECTION_DURATION = 60*60*24*365;

/// @notice A simple decentralized voting system.
/// @notice Ties are broken by the first candidate to reach the most votes.
/// @dev Because of the way that ties are handled, the protocol is vulnerable to front-running attacks, but this is out of the scope of this small demo.
